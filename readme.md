# Spongecell Directory

This is an example project using **Angular.js** to allow for dynamic filtering of the **Spongecell** employee directory on Name, Department, or Location.  The directory data was collected using web-accessible data under fair-use provisions.  Departments were assigned manually, and not terribly accurately.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| -- | -- |

| main.js | Angular JS Code |
| data.json | The source data for the employee directory |

## Disclaimer

This is just a sample project to demonstrate use of Angular in a manner that may be useful.  The data on this page is accessible through web aggrigation services such as Google or Microsoft Bing.
